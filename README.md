# Linear-Equation-Solver

Create an app that shows the 2-step math required to solve a linear equation of the form ax + b = c.

1. Get the values a, b, c from the user.
2. Display the equation.
3. Show the steps to solve it.
4. Ask the user if they would like to run again.

Solve any linear equation of the form:   ax + b = c

Examples

Your equation:    3x + 5 = 8
First step:       3x = 3
Second step:      x = 1

Would you like to run again (y or n)?
Try to make it look nice if b is negative:

Your equation:    5x - 7 = -4
First step:       5x = 3
Second step:      x = 0.6

Would you like to run again (y or n)?
That is, it is ugly to see

Your equation:    5x + -7 = -4
